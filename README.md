# FC-DCNN
Implementation of our lightweight fully-convolutional densely connected neural network method for disparity estimation.
This method has been submitted to the **ICPR 2020** conference and is currently being peer-reviewed.

Upon acceptance this repository will contain:

* Python3 and pytorch 1.0.1 implementation of our FC-DCNN network
* trained weights for:
  * Kitti
  * Middlebury
  * ETH3D 
* python3 script for the full post-processing pipeline as described in our paper
