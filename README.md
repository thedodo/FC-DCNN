##### A densely connected neural network for stereo estimation
Dominik Hirner, Friedrich Fraundorfer

Implementation of our lightweight fully-convolutional densely connected neural network method for disparity estimation.
This method has been submitted to the **ICPR 2020** conference and is currently being peer-reviewed.
A demo of this network is available online.

The network was trained and tested on a GeForce RTX 2080 with 11GB of RAM.
